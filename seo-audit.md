### ⚠️ Opportunities for Improvement

#### On-Page SEO
1. **Content depth**: Single-page site limits keyword targeting opportunities
2. **Heading optimization**: Need to verify H1 contains primary keyword
3. **Internal linking**: Limited due to single-page structure

5. **Keyword variations**: Could incorporate more long-tail keywords

#### Technical SEO
1. **Schema enhancements**: 
   - Add Review/AggregateRating schema for testimonials
   - Add Service schema for specific restoration services
   - Add breadcrumb schema (when multi-page)
   - Missing opening hours in LocalBusiness schema
2. **Sitemap**: Only homepage listed, should include all sections as anchors
3. **Image optimization**: File sizes and format optimization needed
4. **Core Web Vitals**: Need to verify LCP, FID/INP, CLS scores
5. **Structured data testing**: Validate all schema with Google's Rich Results Test

#### Local SEO
1. **Google Business Profile**: Not mentioned - critical for local visibility
2. **NAP consistency**: Need to verify Name, Address, Phone across web
3. **Local citations**: Missing from schema (street address incomplete)
4. **Service area pages**: Could benefit from location-specific content
5. **Reviews**: Testimonials present but not structured for rich snippets

#### Content Strategy
1. **Blog/Resources**: No content marketing strategy evident
2. **Service pages**: All services on one page limits targeting

4. **Project galleries**: Individual project pages would help rankings
5. **Video content**: No video SEO strategy

#### Off-Page SEO
1. **Backlink strategy**: Not evident from current site

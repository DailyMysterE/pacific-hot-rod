# Optimize Mobile Menu Performance

## Issues
- Mobile menu feels laggy when opening/closing
- Need smoother, snappier animations

## Optimizations to Apply
- Reduce animation duration for faster response
- Use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
- Simplify framer-motion animations
- Add will-change CSS hints
- Reduce backdrop blur if present

## Tasks
- [x] Read Header component to analyze current menu implementation
- [x] Optimize animation durations and easing (smoother cubic-bezier)
- [x] Apply performance improvements (will-change hints for GPU acceleration)
- [ ] Save checkpoint
